# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### **Overview of the Analysis**
---
* The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many current employees were eligible for retirement and their current titles. Additionally, the analysis identified mentorship eligible current employees that may work with this retiring workforce to ensure a solid transfer of knowledge ahead of a potential 'silver tsunami.'

### **Results**
---
* The analysis determined that there a total of **72,458** unique titles of employees eligible for retirement that may be a part of the 'silver tsunami.'

* We have also determined that a majority of these retirement eligible employees are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff (see below):

* The analysis determined that there are **1,549** employees eligible for the mentorship program:

* The data also suggests that the bulk of these mentorship candidates are also in Senior Engineer or Senior Staff positions:

### **Summary**
---
* Based on this data, there is a significant population of senior employees who are eligible for retirement.Currently, there would be 72,458 roles to fill. If even half of this group actually retired in the coming years, this would have a significant impact on the company. Luckily, there are more than enough retirement eligible employees to mentor the eligible mentees (72,458 eligible retiress vs. 1,549 eligible mentees). 

* This imbalance of eligible mentees to retirees is concerning, however, the available pool of junior staff for trainig is relatively evenly distributed across multiple departments, perhaps providing a window to do a tiered mentorship program, where these team members then go on to mentor more new hires:

* Additionally, as the table below suggests, there are many retirement age employees who have only recently joined the company in the last twenty years. This may suggest that they are less-likely to retire now as opposed to some one who joing in the mid-90s are sooner. This may help the company parse out what positions/departments the team should focus their mentorship efforts on based in which departments the majority of the oldest tenured staff work.
